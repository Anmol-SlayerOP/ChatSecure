# Phishing Classifier Web Application

This is a web application built using React and FastAPI that uses machine learning to classify phishing messages. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input text messages and get real-time classification results.

ChatSecure provides a solution to this problem by leveraging machine learning algorithms to classify any text or message as either phishing or legitimate. By using natural language processing techniques, the application analyzes the content and characteristics of messages to accurately determine their nature. Users can quickly identify and separate phishing messages, allowing them to focus on genuine communications and avoid potential security risks.

## Features

- **Phishing Classification**: Users can input text messages and instantly classify them as phishing or non-phishing using the trained machine learning model.
- **Dashboard**: The dashboard provides an overview of statistics and figures related to phishing messages, including the number of phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, and malware attacks.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate, input messages, and view the classification results.
